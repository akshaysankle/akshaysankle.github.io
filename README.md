## Welcome to Zukros Websites



The universe has a beginning,but no end.
Infinite.
Stars have beginnings too,
but meet an end of their own making.
Finite.
History has shown that those
with wisdom are the greatest fools of all.
Fish that live in the sea know nothing of land.
If they had that wisdom,
they,too,would be ruined.
For humans to exceed the speed of light...
...is more foolish than for fish to start living on land.
These words are meant for those who dare to defy God's final warning...
An epigrapgh for their stubborness.
