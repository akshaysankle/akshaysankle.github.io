The universe has a beginning,but no end.
Infinite.

Stars have beginnings too,
but meet an end of their own making.
Finite.

History has shown that those
with wisdom are the greatest fools of all.

Fish that live in the sea know nothing of land.
If they had that wisdom,
they,too,would be ruined.

For humans to exceed the speed of light...
...is more foolish than for fish to start living on land.

These words are meant for those who dare to defy God's final warning...
An epigrapgh for their stubborness.

## Processing 
- A programming environment based on the Java language. Used as a tool to introduce people to the concepts of programming, and in production environments. The Arduino IDE is written in Processing, and so will look very familiar. In addition, Processing, Arduino and Galileo share a similar philosophy and motive, of creating free open source tools allowing non-technical people to work with hardware and software.

Common types of transistors include the Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) and the Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET).

U
## Unsigned 
- A term used to describe a datatypes, indicating that they cannot be a negative number. It’s helpful to have an unsigned number if you only need to count in one direction. For instance, when keeping track of time with millis(), it’s advisable to use the unsigned long datatype.

V
## Variable 
- A datatype that stores values which are likely to change as your program runs. A variable’s type depends on the type of information you want to store, and the maximum size of the information; for example, a byte can store up to 256 different values, but an int can store up t 65,536 different values. Variables can be local to a particular block of code, or global to an entire program. (see Global variable, Local variable).

## Voltage divider 
- A type of circuit that provides an output that is a fraction of its input voltage. You are building a voltage divider when you combine a photoresistor with a fixed resistor to provide an analog input. A potentiometer can also be used as a voltage divider.
